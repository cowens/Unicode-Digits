Unicode-Digits

    So, you have matched a string with "\d" and now want to do some math.
    What is that you say?  The number your captured plus 5 is 5?  Oh, that
    is right \d now matches UNICODE digits not [0−9].  What to do?  Well,
    You can just call "digits_to_int" and all of your troubles* are over!

        use Unicode::Digits;

        my $string = "forty−two in Mongolian is \x{1814}\x{1812}";
        my $num = digits_to_int $string =~ /(\d+)/;
        print $num + 5, "\n";

    Also try the refereshing dualvar varient:

        my $dual = digits_to_dual $string =~ /(\d+)/;
        print "$dual is ", $dual + 0, "\n";
